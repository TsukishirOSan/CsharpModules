Module 2
/**
* For this assignment, you will create the pattern of a chess board that is 8 x 8. Use X and O to represent the squares.

Create the appropriate nested looping structure to output the characters in an 8 x 8 grid on the screen using Console.Write() or Console.WriteLine() as appropriate.
Include a decision structure to ensure that alternate rows start with opposite characters as a real chess board alternates the colors among rows.
This is what your output should look like.
